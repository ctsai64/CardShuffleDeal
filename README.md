# CardShuffleDeal

Watching your friend deal cards is like hitting every red light on the road: 
Boring, Annoying, and Unnecessary.

A human dealer stops, starts, and stops again. 
They pause to shuffle, miscount cards, and simply can’t move fast enough.

**Big Deal is an autonomous playing card shuffler and dealer.**

Given a number of players and a number of cards to be dealt, Big Deal will continuously and efficiently distribute cards to each player.

Big Deal is a green light. The cards keep moving so you can too.

Winning is a Big Deal.
